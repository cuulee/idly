#BUGs
-  when you click a group by zooming out, now this group is in modifiedEntities. If you somehow bring a virgin entity in the click buffer of both these groups. And you click the virgin entitiy nothing happens. what should have hapenned is, it should have made all of them modified entity. If the you outside buffer click everything works normally.
